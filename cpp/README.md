This example demonstrates that our solution can visualize any network with smart
contracts written in any language; particulary, in C++.

You will need a C++ compiler, GNU Make, and `libcurl` with its header files.

1. Compile this simulation by running `make`.

2. Make sure the server (`main.py` from the root of the repository) is running.

3. Direct your browser to http://localhost:8080

4. Run `./main`

5. Switch to the browser and enjoy :-)
